### Connecting your online community with the real world, one conference at a time.

Built in 4 hours to help me track who I wanted to meet at Laracon 2014, and who I met there who I didn't know yet.

Updated for Laravel 5.1 and Vue in 2015/2016. @michaeldyrynda did most of the hard work there, and we documented it [on a podcast](http://rebuilding.confomo.com/).
